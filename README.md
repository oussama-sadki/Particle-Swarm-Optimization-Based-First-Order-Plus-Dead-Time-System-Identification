# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based-First-Order-Plus-Dead-Time-System-Identification
This project applies one of the most used and efficient optimization algorithms namely Particle Swarm Optimization for system identification purpose.
PSO is a stochastic optimization technique inspired by swarm behaviour observed in nature such as bird and fish schooling,these particles(fish/birds) are flown through hyperdimensional search space. Each particle has a position and velocity and is evaluated through an objective function that we want to maximize or minimize. Once all particles are assessed, we select the best one (solution that maximize or minimize our objective function) and we tune the other particles'position and velocities so to track it, this particle is usually called pbest(best particle). As PSO is an iterative process,particles continue to move around the search space and look for more best solutions. After each iteration, a global best solution is selected based upon the performance of the previous iterations. The Dynamic of particles is adjusted by the mean of a set of coeffcients to speed up or slow down particles'position and velocities
